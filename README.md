# DataBases_2022-2023
Project proposed by Dr. Surdu Sabina

This project is how I imagined a database for a musical instruments shop would be structured.

Lab2 -> contains queries with different SQL Statements that use several different operators

Lab3 -> implemented stored procedures for the database and created a procedure that is used
to go through different versions of the database (i.e. the creation of a new table, the removal
of an integrity constraint) and also revert these changes.

Lab4 -> implemented large data generation procedures to test the performance of the database

Lab5 -> used different types of indexes to see which is suitable for different operations
on the database
